# AE-199-IAC-Dump

Code dump from AE 199 IAC: introduction to matlab. Many files explore topics including structures, thermal ODEs, and flow. The purpose of them were to explore the capabilities of matlab's functions and calls. 

Very few comments will exist in these codes and the context may be unclear but are around for reference as matlab learning materials for syntax and some advanced work.
